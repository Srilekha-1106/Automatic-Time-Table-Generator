# AUTOMATIC TIMETABLE GENERATOR USING GENETIC ALGORITHM

Timetable scheduling for a variety of courses is a complex and manual task often resulting in suboptimal outcomes. This project demonstrates using evolutionary strategies, inspired by Darwin's ideas, to address the timetabling problem through a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The primary objective is to generate optimal, clash-free timetables, significantly reducing manual effort. Additionally, the project aims to create a generic system capable of producing uniform timetables that meet the needs of any educational institution.

The project features include a Genetic Algorithm for scheduling, input handling, local search and heuristic crossover, and a user-friendly web interface. The GA, inspired by natural evolution, solves the NP-hard problem of timetable scheduling by taking inputs such as courses, faculty, classrooms, and time slots. It ensures fundamental constraints are not violated while generating timetables tested to meet user-specified constraints.

A web application provides a simple interface for inputting data and displaying generated timetables. This setup allows users to easily input data and receive timetables quickly. The project combines timetable generation with a Genetic Algorithm and a user-friendly interface, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of using GAs to solve complex scheduling issues and reduce manual effort. 

The web page interface allows users to input data easily.
